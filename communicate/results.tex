To assess Sprintz's effectiveness, we implemented both it and comparison algorithms in C++ and Python. All of our code and raw results are publicly available on the Sprintz website.\footnote{https://github.com/dblalock/sprintz} This website also contains experiments on additional datasets, as well as thorough documentation of both our code and experimental setups. All experiments use a single thread on a 2013 Macbook Pro with a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7-4960HQ processor.

All reported timings and throughputs are the best of 5 runs, averaged over 10 trials (i.e., the code is executed 50 times). We use the best in each trial, rather than average, since this is standard practice in performance benchmarking.

\subsection{Datasets}
% ------------------------------------------------

For assessing accuracy, we use several datasets widely used to benchmark Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ) algorithms:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=4mm]
\item \textbf{Batman} \cite{batman} --- Also known as the Caped Crusader. Don't ask what compression means here, because I couldn't tell you.
\end{itemize}

For all datasets, we separate the first 5\% of the data

% Experiments on additional datasets are availble on the Bolt website.

\subsection{Comparison Algorithms}
% ------------------------------------------------

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=4mm]
\item \textbf{Wishful Thinking} \cite{batman} --- We just really hope that the data gets compressed and assume that it will.
\item \textbf{Encouragement} \cite{barney} --- We foster a positive environment and allow the data to compress itself when it feels ready.
\end{itemize}

Look, a bar graph.

Yep. Real fast.

Such small. Very compress.
